          <p>Another year has passed and this has been the best yet. Most years fly by without me having any real record of what I have achieved or where I need to improve to better myself, so this year I decided to set myself a <a href="/goals/2010">list of goals</a> to help shape my life. My list was split into for sections: Personal, Fitness, Programming and Business so I will follow that theme with this review.</p>

<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>

<p>This part was about bettering myself as a person. Gaining new experiences, seeing new things and opening my mind. I have read a great few books, namely <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>Tiger Force</em>, <em>Dune</em> (that was a bloody effort) and a few other less known books such as <em>I Am Not A Serial Killer</em> and <em>The Outsider</em>; both of which make you really question your mental state.</p>

<p>I crossed the pond for the first time and visited San Francisco which was an amazing experience. While I was there I went to EECI2010 and while I didn’t get to speak again it was a brilliant time and a bizarre interval amongst two weeks of drinking with hostel buddies. I headed up to Canada and spent some time with Lee Tengum and his family. Everything you have heard about Canadian hospitality is true, but their bacon is worthless.</p>

<h3 id="fitness">Fitness</h3>

<p>Total letdown. I started off the year training for the Bath Half Marathon which I was very proud to finish in 1:59 after suffering some knee problems 2 miles from the end. God knows what I did, probably not enough warm-up and cool-down while I was training but they are shot. This was only March so my plans to train for the Tough Guy, Grime Challenge or London to Paris Cycle were shot. I still get pain walking now!</p>

<p>The Kayaking has gone very well. I’ve gone from a wobbly regular swimmer to being a confident paddler who is not afraid of a challenge. I’ve learned to roll although I have yet to try it in anger, but I’m sure the opportunity will come up soon. I sadly did not achieve my 3* award this year but not through any fault of my own. I am on a course which starts in two weeks, so that’s not really a fail right?</p>

<h3 id="programming">Programming</h3>

<p>Oh dear god the coding, THE CODING. IT HASN’T STOPPED!</p>

<p>This year was about coding new things and breaking out of my stagnant slump of 100% PHP and building CodeIgniter CMS by day and another CodeIgniter CMS by night.</p>

<p>I’ve made a few ExpressionEngine Add-ons; the very well accepted <a href="http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/rest">Rest</a> and the basically un-noticed <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/widgets/127932?ref=pjsturgeon">Widgets</a> which hit a goal and made some cash. This seemed like a market and community I would be interested in getting into as it meant leaving the CMS dev to others while I just make some buckaroos, but with no real understanding of client needs or experience building sites with it I soon realized I was just doing it for the sake of it. On the plus side if a client needs me to build add-ons for EE then I can do it, but I won’t be trying to take on <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/">Pixel &amp; Tonic</a> or <a href="http://leevigraham.com/cms-customisation/expressionengine/">Leevi Graham</a> any time soon.</p>

<p>As for learning new languages, I left this a little late. I got all over <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> with some videos from Think Vitamin and a lot of pestering <a href="http://twitter.com/elliottkember">Elliott Kember</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/reddavis">Red Davis</a> for help. I have worked past the initial honey-moon period and wont go around telling everyone to use it all the time for everything as so many other converts do, but I will say that it’s fucking awesome. What started off as a simple learning exercise is blossoming into a full-blown web-app called <a href="http://travlrapp.com/">Travlr</a> which will really come into it’s own soon.</p>

<p>I have stolen sourced several ideas from Rails for a new framework started by <a href="http://dhorrigan.com/">Dan Horrigan</a> that myself and others are working on called <a href="http://fuelphp.com/">FUEL</a>. It combines the best of Kohana, CodeIgniter, Rails and a few other bits and bobs, combined with a huge amount of our own ideas and community contributions. The BETA will hopefully be 01/01/2011, so it’s nearly ready for world domination.</p>

<p>But where does that leave CodeIgniter? Well I am still loving it “long-time” and now I have commit access to a new community branch: <a href="/blog/2010/12/ellislab-react-with-codeigniter-reactor">CodeIgniter Reactor</a> which will be out soon too. The contributors (or Engineers) are a brilliant group who I have a great deal of respect for. Contributing to this project is a great feeling as finally I can directly contribute to the framework I use every day and help improve it for everyone.</p>

<p>Sadly my Objective-C goes as far as Hello World! and I haven’t even scratched the surface of Python but there are only so many hours in the day. I have a decent understanding of C and feel confident that I will be on top of iPhone App development in the New Year, with the first app being iTravlr.</p>

<h3 id="business">Business</h3>

<p>Now for all this open-source coding and writing, I still need to make some money. I was asked to write a CodeIgniter Cookbook but Packt bailed on me after I spent weeks writing up the outlines. To be honest: I am glad. You work your arse off for those guys and get 20% of not much.</p>

<p>On a more positive note I have managed to get the <a href="http://pyrocms.com/store">PyroCMS Add-on Store</a> up and have teamed up with a brilliant designer Scott Parry of <a href="http://www.ikreativ.com/about">iKreativ</a>. Working together we will be an unstoppable force of web-app creating ninja fiends. In all, business is looking good for 2011.</p>
